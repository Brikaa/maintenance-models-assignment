\section{Introduction}
This article briefly discusses what maintenance models are, why we study them,
and what the quick fix model is and suggests advice to abide by when using the quick fix model.
The article assumes the reader already knows what software maintenance means.

\section{What are software maintenance models?}
Software maintenance models are abstract descriptions of
the sequence of activities in the software maintenance process,
the input to each activity, the output produced from each activity
and, optionally, metrics that can be applied on the outputs of each activity to evaluate the maintenance process
and functions that can be applied while executing the activities to control the maintenance process.
